Recursion and iteration are two different techniques for solving problems, particularly useful in programming when you need to perform a repetitive task. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of their key differences:

Defination:
Recursion is a function that calls itself again and again until the base cindition is met. Whereas Iteration is a set of instructions that is run repeatedly in a loop.

Approach:
In recursion, we solve the problem by breaking it into smaller problems whereas in iteration, we repeat a block of code until a condition is met.

Memory usage:
Recursion uses more memory due to call stack frames but Iteration is more memory efficient due to fixed staack space.

Code Reradibility:
Recursion makes the code more readable than Iteration. It is easier to test and debug the recusion than the iteration.

Termination:
Rcursion requires a base case to terminate whereas in Iteration, it terminates when a specified condition is satisfifed.

Performance:
Recursion can be slower due to stack overhead. Iterations aregenerally more faster due to absence of stack call overhead.

Usage:
Recursion is generally used to solve a complex problem using a recurive function whereas Iteration is used to sove any problem with known number of iteration.
